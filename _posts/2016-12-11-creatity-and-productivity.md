#### This is a post that I wrote in February - 2016 on my last blog. I think it is worth it putting it here.

I never considered myself as 'creative'. In fact, I often saw myself as a very uncreative person. I never had many new ideas and struggled so much to come up with new game mechanics or drawings or whatever that involved creating new stuff.

Recently, I have been noticing that my productivity is also dropping quite a lot. I am trying to avoid working up on projects, I am not that interested in finishing school work and I caught myself several times thinking about sleeping in the middle of the day (which is something that I always hated by the way).

Fast forward to about a week ago, which is when my 'Business & Enterprise' class started. One of the first topics that was covered is how your habitat can affect these two things. And, I know this is kind of 'common knowledge', but I never really stopped and looked around me to see my actual habitat and how could I improve it.

The conclusion that I reached is that my habitat is slowly killing these two things. I am currently living in a 10m² bedroom, with bland walls, absolute no sunlight, and no decorations other than a few Dota 2 plushies in my window. When I stop and think about the times that I was in a good mood and ready to do stuff and I simply stopped and started entering in a sad and lazy state because I was in my room feeling trapped I see that I wasted so much time!

The worst part about all of this is that I am in this situation for pretty much my whole life. And I am in this ambient for at least half of my day. It is absolutely maddening when I think about it.

Right now I am trying to avoid my room as much as possible. I am going back to Brazil in a few months so I really can't do much when it comes to changing my room. Maybe I'll rearrange all my furniture, that had a good effect in the past. Going to cafés, staying in my living room or just going somewhere random seems to be working.

The point of this post is just to raise awareness. You should check your surroundings and see what you can change to make it more habitable. Go all in if you can. Buy weird furniture, paint your walls, put posters up, let the sun come in as much as possible. There is so many things you can do that will most likely make your brain work better.

Just run away from this 'bland-state', and as fast as you possibly can.
