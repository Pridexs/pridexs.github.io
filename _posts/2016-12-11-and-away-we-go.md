I often prefer to keep my thoughts to myself and don't really have much to talk. But when my mind wanders off to unknown places, I often find myself wanting to share some ideas with strangers. This is where those reveries end up.

Here you will *probably* find stories, ideas, random thoughts, experiments, etc. Anything that I find relevant, even if it is just for me.

Feel free to express your ideas in the comment section. I will try to keep an eye on that every now and then.

I sincerely hope you can take something good out of this blog.
