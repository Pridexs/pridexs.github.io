I've always used Wordpress when I wanted to set up a quick blog. It is easy to use, easy to set up, has pretty much every function that you will ever need and more.

But Wordpress is also clunky, if set up incorrectly it can be slow, and not to mention the many security vulnerabilities that are there because it tries to be *too much* (well, it succeeds at it but at a cost).

I was hosting my website and my blog on a Virtual Machine at Digital Ocean, but there was a point that I just stopped and looked at how much of that VM was being used. The conclusion that I got was that I was throwing money out of the window for no reason.

I don't blog much, I don't have many people that read my blog, so why was I paying 10 bucks a month for pretty much nothing? I occasionally used the VM to run a few applications every now and then, but I can use the credit that I have at Amazon EC2 to do that.

Looking for solutions to my problem I found [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is a static site generator aimed at small websites and most importantly blogs. You can easily create a blog that uses no Databases and does not require a server behind that runs PHP, Python or any other language.

That means that it is fast, reliable, does not require a whole lot of knowledge on servers to set up, **and**, the best feature is that you can host it for free on GitHub Pages!

I have considered using others CMS's, like Wagtail for Django (which seems to be pretty good compared to Wordpress), but then again, I simply don't need a CMS. I am the only person modifying this blog, it is as simple as it can be, so why complicate?

Jekyll is pretty easy to set up and has a ton of themes if you are not much into web-design like myself. If you are looking for a simple solution for a simple blog/website I strongly suggest using Jekyll.

Hurray for mo more Content Management Systems!
