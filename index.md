I am a **Computer Scientist** student at UDESC, Santa Catarina, Brazil. I have also studied one year abroad at the Dublin Institute of Technology through the Science Without Borders programme.

The areas that I am most interested are in high performance computing, computer networks, virtual machines, servers, game development, and theory of computation.

Aside from computers, more often than not I find myself lost in the world of photography and/or philosophy.

Always trying to understand it all, a bit of everything. Perhaps my worst weakness, or my biggest strength, I have not come to a conclusion on that matter yet.

If you want to know more about my academic formation/experiences go to my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/{{ site.author.linkedin }}), if you want to get a look at some of my code go to my [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}) and I am always happy when people check out my photos so go look at my [Flickr](https://flickr.com/{{ site.author.flickr }}) if you want to see the world through my eyes.
