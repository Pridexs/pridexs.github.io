Hello, you! I'm really bad at writing biographies, but I will try to do my best here.

I have a Bachelor's degere in Computer Science from Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina (UDESC) and a Bachelor's degree from Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG).

Currently, I'm primarily a Data Scientist, but I'm also really interested in the many adjacent topics that DS has, such as Data Engineering, DevOps, MLOps, Software Engineering, and so on. I'm 
also currently working at [iFood](https://institucional.ifood.com.br/), the leading food delivery company in Brazil.

In my free time, I also like to explore some Game Dev coding, but it's been quite a while since I haven't touched anything related to that. This website/blog is also an attempt to go back and start posting some interesting stuff related to it.

Aside from CS stuff, I also really enjoy photography, especially analog photography. Due to COVID stuff, I've been somewhat inconsistent with this hobby (also, analog films are expensive at the moment), but I want to get back to it as soon as possible.

Other than that, please feel free to follow me on any of my socials listed :smile:

Cheers and have a great day!
